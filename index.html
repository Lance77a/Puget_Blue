        <p class="quote">EVERYONE should experiance the Puget this way! I can't believe how much I learned while
            "working out" and having an amazing time! We had Cody for our guide and he kept a great pace and made sure
            none of us got too far behind. I'll definetly be coming back to try a Kayak soon!</p>
        <p class="author">- Jackson S.</p>
        <p class="quote">Wow! My wife and I had our doubts about going all out on the day long adventure, (primarily
            whether or not we were up to the task.) But we are soooooo glad we went for it! The tour was absolutely
            beautiful and we really felt like we DID something BIG. And now we can't wait to try another route!</p>
        <p class="author">- Judith D.</p>
        <p class="quote">My friends and I had a blast on the Boat tour! Might not be as exhilirating as a bike ride but
            it was just as stunning. Maybe more so since we had wine on the boat! Special thanks to our tour guide,
            Mikaila. We'll see you agin soon!</p>
